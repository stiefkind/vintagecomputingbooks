# Vintage Computing Books by Wolfgang ’stiefkind’ Stief

This repository hosts is list of the books in my private library
mostly regarding vintage computing, vintage computer architecture, and
some Unix history. It happens regularly, that I found an interesting
book on eBay, but am not sure, if it sits already on some
shelf or not. So this list is written and updated primarily for
myself.

Books can happen to be listed more then once, because they fit into
more than one category. Numbers in the format *bk??* refer to the
storage location of the book.
