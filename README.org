This file is list of the books in my private library regarding vintage
computing, vintage computer architecture, and some Unix history. It
happens regularly, that I found a book interesting on eBay, but am not
sure, if it sits already on some shelf or not. So this list is written
and updated primarily for myself.

Some books happen to be listed more then once, because they fit intp
more than one category.
